        <p id="para">During the first part of your life, you only become aware of happiness once you have lost it. Then an age
            comes, a second one, in which you already know, at the moment when you begin to experience true happiness, that you
            are, at the end of the day, going to lose it. When I met Belle, I understood that I had just entered this second
            age. I also understood that I hadnâ€™t reached the third age, in which anticipation of the loss of happiness prevents
            you from living.
            Your only chance of survival, if you are sincerely smitten, lies in hiding this fact from the woman you love, of
            feigning a casual detachment under all circumstances. What sadness there is in this simple observation! What an
            accusation against man! However, it had never occurred to me to contest this law, nor to imagine disobeying it: love
            makes you weak.
